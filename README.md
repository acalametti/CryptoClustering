# CryptoClustering

Contributor: Alex Calametti


Overview: 

The goal of this project was to analyze if cryptocurrencies are affected by 7-day or 24-hour price changes using Python and unsupervised learning. 

Programs and files: 

- Python, Sklearn, pandas
- Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb
- crypto_market_data_csv

Steps:

- Prepared the data by using StandardScaler() module to normalize data and created DataFrame

- Found the best K value using the scaled DataFrame by creating an elbow curve

- Clustered the cryptocurrency with the K-means found from the elbow curve and plotted the dataâ€º

- Used principle component analysis to optimize the clusters and reduced the features to three different principles and created a new DataFrame
- Found the explained variance of the three principle components
- Found the best k value based on the PCA data by creating a new elbow curve

-   Lastly, crytpocurrencies were clusteres using the K-means from the PCA data and a new plot was created
